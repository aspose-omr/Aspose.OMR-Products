[Aspose.OMR for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/omr/net/) is an optical mark recognition API for generating and recognizing answer sheets of MCQ papers, quiz tests, feedback forms like surveys and all type of balloting forms. Programmers can easily integrate API within their OMR software solutions or building applications from scratch such as grade or GPA calculator, grade percentage or generating answer sheets. API supports multiple image formats including JPEG, PNG, GIF, TIFF and BMP.

1. Create [OmrEngine class](https://apireference.aspose.com/omr/net/aspose.omr.api/omrengine) object.
2. Using the object, get the omr file path and assign to [TemplateProcessor](https://apireference.aspose.com/omr/net/aspose.omr.api/templateprocessor).
3. Define the GIF image path and use [RecognizeImage method](https://apireference.aspose.com/omr/net/aspose.omr.api/templateprocessor/methods/recognizeimage) to get the result.
4. Write the result into CSV by defining its path and using [RecognitionResult.GetCsv Method](https://apireference.aspose.com/omr/net/aspose.omr.model/recognitionresult/methods/getcsv) while writing into file.
