1. Create [OmrEngine class](https://apireference.aspose.com/omr/net/aspose.omr.api/omrengine) object.
2. Using the object, get the path to the JSON markup file using [GenerateTemplate](https://apireference.aspose.com/omr/net/aspose.omr.api/omrengine/methods/generatetemplate) and assign the result to [GenerationResult class](https://apireference.aspose.com/omr/net/aspose.omr.generation/generationresult).
3. Call the Save method with path to the folder where the results will be saved and the name of the generated template and image as parameter.
