{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/content h2="National Eligibility cum Entrance Test" %}}

<p>The National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) is the uniform entrance examination for admission to MBBS, BDS, BAMS, BSMS, BUMS, BHMS, and other medical courses in colleges, universities, and institutes of India. A successful test result is a must-have for postgraduate and undergraduate students pursuing a primary medical education abroad. The NEET is a pen-and-paper exam with 180 questions, making it almost impossible to check and evaluate results manually. Automated form reading (OMR) becomes a critical element of the assessment.</p>

<p>Aspose.OMR is a powerful optical mark recognition (OMR) engine that can convert a regular computer into an optical reader / scoring machine. Creating, recognizing, and scoring multiple-choice tests becomes a trivial task, even for those with minimal knowledge of programming languages. Forget tedious and error-prone manual scoring of OMR answer sheets or waiting for a Scantron device. Just take a photo of a completed OMR form in class and instantly get a result.</p>

<p>Download the form to practice the NEET exam at schools, institutes, and coaching centers. Use it for self-practice as well as for training the NEET aspirants. The downloadable form is completely free to use at your discretion.</p>

<p>Use Aspose.OMR to customize every aspect of the NEET OMR form, including color and font, and add your branding. Simply modify the source files and generate a PDF page or a printable PNG image for your preferred paper type. For practicing specific areas of the test, you can even change the number of questions and exclude certain sections, such as Physics, Chemistry, or Biology.</p>

To add it to your project, you just need to install the *Aspose.OMR* [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.omr) package in your project with the following command:

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="" offSpacer="true" %}}

```cs

  PM> Install-Package Aspose.OMR
 
```

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block %}}

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Instructions" %}}
Follow the guidelines below on using, customizing, and reading the NEET exam form with Aspose.OMR.

<h3>Filling out the NEET sheet</h3>

<p>NEET is a uniform exam with a fixed pattern. Thus, candidates must follow precise instructions during the training tests to familiarize themselves with the actual test expectations:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The maximum exam duration is 3 hours 20 minutes (200 minutes).</li>
	<li>Only one bubble should be filled per question.</li>
	<li>The bubble’s circle should be completely filled with a pen or a black marker.</li>
	<li>Avoid any stray marks, especially those that cross the bubbles or a barcode.</li>
	<li>To enter the student’s name and contact information, mark a bubble with a letter or number per column.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Customizing the NEET sheet</h3>

<p>NEET exam has a unified form with 180 questions broken into Physics, Chemistry, Botany, and Zoology sections. While it is highly recommended to follow the original pattern for training, you can easily tune up the form to focus on certain areas of the test by removing sections or changing the number of answers in them.</p>

<p><b>Customize the NEET sheet:</b></p>

<ul type="1">
	<li>Open the NEET form’s source code (neet.txt) with any plain text editor.</li>
	<li>Change the source code according to the guidelines.</li>
	<li>Customize the paper size, bubble color, font, and other global page settings.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Once complete, run the following code to generate a printable template for the NEET form:</b></p>

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="C# Code to Generate OMR Template" offSpacer="true" %}}

```cs

    Aspose.OMR.Api.OmrEngine omrEngine = new Aspose.OMR.Api.OmrEngine();

         Aspose.OMR.Generation.GlobalPageSettings globalPageSettings = new Aspose.OMR.Generation.GlobalPageSettings() {
         PaperSize = Aspose.OMR.Generation.PaperSize.Letter,
         BubbleColor = Aspose.OMR.Generation.Color.Red
    };
    
```

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block %}}


<p>Simple print out the template.png file from the target folder and distribute the papers to your students or trainees of NEET courses. You can also save a template as a single-page PDF document.</p>

<h3>Recognizing the completed NEET sheet</h3>

<p>To recognize a filled NEET form, digitize it in one of the supported formats. There is no need for an expensive hardware reader, such as Scantron. For best results, a basic office scanner or multifunction copier will suffice. If you do not have a scanner, simply take a picture of the form with any modern smartphone or camera.</p>
<p>To read the completed NEET sheet, use the following code:</p>

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="C# Code to recognize a filled NEET form" offSpacer="true" %}}

```cs

    Aspose.OMR.Api.OmrEngine omrEngine = new Aspose.OMR.Api.OmrEngine();
    Aspose.OMR.Api.TemplateProcessor recognitionEngine = omrEngine.GetTemplateProcessor("neet.omr");
    Aspose.OMR.Model.RecognitionResult recognitionResult = recognitionEngine.RecognizeImage("scanned-sheets/Sandeep-Vaishya.png");
    string result = recognitionResult.GetCsv();
    
```

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block %}}

<p><a href="/omr/exam/neet/neet.zip"><b>neet.omr</b></a> file contains a recognition pattern that is used to produce highly accurate results with the Aspose.OMR recognition engine. It is generated alongside the printable NEET template; make sure you do not delete or replace that file. </p>
