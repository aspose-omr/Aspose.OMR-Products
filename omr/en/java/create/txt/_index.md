1. Create [OmrEngine class](https://apireference.aspose.com/omr/java/com.aspose.omr/OmrEngine#generateTemplate-java.lang.String-) object.
2. Using the object, get the path to the txt markup file using [generateTemplate](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/omr/com.aspose.omr/OmrEngine#generateTemplate-java.lang.String-) and assign the result to [GenerationResult class](https://apireference.aspose.com/omr/java/com.aspose.omr/GenerationResult).
3. Call the Save method with path to the folder where the results will be saved and the name of the generated template and image as parameter.
