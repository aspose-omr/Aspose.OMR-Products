<p>Paper-based elections offer distinct advantages over electronic voting systems. They foster voter confidence and trust by providing tangible evidence and allowing for physical recounts. Paper ballots are accessible and inclusive, accommodating individuals with diverse backgrounds and technological capabilities. They also ensure security, reliability, and cost-effectiveness while enabling independent oversight and verification. Moreover, paper-based elections reduce technological barriers and errors, ensuring a fair and transparent democratic process. Embracing these advantages preserves the integrity of elections in an increasingly digital world.
</p> 
<p>While paper-based elections have their advantages, it is important to note that modern technology can enhance the efficiency and accuracy of processing paper ballots. Optical Mark Recognition (OMR) technology can be employed to automate the data extraction process from filled-in paper ballots. OMR software scans the marked ballots, recognizes the optical marks, and converts them into digital data for analysis and tabulation. This hybrid approach combines the benefits of paper-based elections with the convenience of electronic processing, ensuring faster and more precise results.
